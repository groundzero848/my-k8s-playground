# my-k8s-playground

Using vagrant and virtualbox on an ubuntu 20.04 micropc to build up a test k8s environment. I'm a n00b to vagrant and will keep this as simple as possible as my time to be spent on k8s, not the underlying infrastructure.

Installed virtual box and vagrant:

<code>sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install virtualbox vagrant -y</code>
